### My Thoughts about the Article
This article is about game developers' response to the recent announcement of Unity's new pricing model. I've seen quite a bit of discourse online about the negative impacts of this new pricing model when Unity first announced it. Hence, I was quite interested to learn how game developers affected by this have been fighting back against the changes. I am happy that these game developers have banded together against Unity in order to fight these predatory changes and I hope that they will be succesful.
